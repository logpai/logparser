# Spell

Spell is a structured Streaming Parser for Event Logs using an LCS (longest common subsequence) based approach. Spell parses unstructured log messages into structured message templates and parameters in an online streaming fashion. We implemented Spell using Python with a nice interface for benchmarking purpose.
