# Logmatch

Logmatch implements a regular expression based method for matching log messages to a given set of message templates. It can be utilized for log parsing in a streaming manner after obtaining the set of message templates beforehand by training a learning-based logparser, e.g., Drain.

### Running

The code has been tested in the following enviornment:
+ python 3.7.6
+ regex 2022.3.2
+ pandas 1.0.1
+ numpy 1.18.1
+ scipy 1.4.1

Run the following scripts to start the demo:

```
python demo.py
```
