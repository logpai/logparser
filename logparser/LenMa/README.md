# LenMa

LenMa is one of the representative log parsers that utilizes the token length properties of log messages for event template extraction. The authors open source [the original prototype implementation on Github](https://github.com/keiichishima/templateminer). We further wrap up the code with a standard interface for benchmarking purpose.
